# The Objectives ðŸ¥…

## Primary objective

Find below some data we want to display in the browser (data.js). Create a WebApp that displays the data below in a reusable tree component that allows for browsing the data structure and opening and closing the navigation nodes. We later want to use it throughout the application and might ask you for more functionality if there is time. Find your personal right balance between quality and functionality. Feel free to make it prettier and improve the design and user experience.

## Secondary objective

If you have the time, set up a simple backend that allows the Webapp to pull this data via http from a backend. Ideally pull the data into the WebApp so it works and renders as it did with the mock before. Consider that this is the seed of our whole cloud infrastructure and find the right trade-off between simplicity and extensibility.
